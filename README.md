# Savanna-Vegetation-Model-BioSaVe

This repository supplements our manuscript entitled "Balanced functional herbivore composition stabilizes tree-grass coexistence and productivity in a simulated savanna rangeland ecosystem."

The model simulates grass and tree cover as well as grass and tree biomass of a savanna landscape. It includes ecohydrological dynamics based on Synodinos et al. 2015. The modelled landscape has a resolution of one hectare with a total size of 10000 ha (100 km2), representing the typical scale of a rangeland farm in the area of southern Africa. We use the model to analyze the impact of different herbivore compositions grazing and browsing on the vegetation.
